# PartyPlanner2-Allamaneni
APCS Party Planner Project

The main class file is Main.java. In the Party Planner Project, the code takes a csv file and organizes all the names in it to make a roster of what table and chair each person sits in. The code makes sure that only one person from each company can sit at each table.

The user will be able to add people manually to the listand then prompted and may choose one of the folllowing options:

-search and print a specific person's info

-print a table and info of the people sitting at that table

-print a company amd people the at belong to it

I approched this by organizing the list of people by whose company has the most amount of people. Then I looped through each person and placed them in a table. If the table already had a person with the same company, I would check the next table.
